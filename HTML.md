# HTML Notes
## Wireframe and Design
**Wireframing** is a practice used by UX designers which allows them to define and plan the information hierarchy of their design for a website, app, or product. Wireframes can be drawn out and/or created through software programs such as Figma and Invision. There are 6 steps to make a wireframe:

1. Do your research: user personas, use cases, understanding best practices
2. Prepare your research for quick reference
3. Make sure you have your user flow mapped out
4. Draft, don't draw. Sketch, don't illustrate
5. Add some detail and get testing
6. Start turning your wireframes into prototypes

**Three key principles for good wireframes**

1. **Clarity**: Your wireframe needs to answer the questions of what that site page is, what the user can do there, and if it satisfies their needs.
2. **Confidence**: Ease of navigation through your site and clear calls-to-action increase user confidence in your brand.
3. **Simplicity** is key: Too much information, copy, or links, can be distracting to the user and will have a detrimental affect on your users’ ability to achieve their goals. You want your users to be able to find their way through your site with as little extra ‘fluff’ as possible, to the elements that map to their most significant goals in a given context.

## HTML Basics
**HTML** is a *markup language* that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.

**The main parts of our element are as follows:**

**The opening tag**: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.
**The closing tag**: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.
**The content:** This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.
**The element:** The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.

**Attributes** contain extra information about the element that you don't want to appear in the actual content. Here, class is the attribute name and editor-note is the attribute value. The class attribute allows you to give the element a non-unique identifier that can be used to target it (and any other elements with the same class value) with style information and other things.

**An attribute should always have the following:**

1. A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute, if the element already has one or more attributes).
2. The attribute name followed by an equal sign.
3. The attribute value wrapped by opening and closing quotation marks.

## Semantics
In programming, [**Semantics**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics) refers to the *meaning* of a piece of code — for example "what effect does running that line of JavaScript have?", or "what purpose or role does that HTML element have" (rather than "what does it look like?".).
