# Git Intro Notes

## **Version Control**

Allows you to revisit various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes. One can revert a file or project to a previous version, track modifications and modifying invididuals, and compare changes. Mistakes with files can easily be rectified by utilizing a Version Control System (VCS)

- Centralized Version Control System (CVCS): a single server storing all changes and file versions, that can be accessed by various clients.
- Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS): allows clients to create mirrored repositories. Git is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots.
- Commit: each time you save a changed version of your project
- Files in Git can reside in three main states: committed, modified, and staged

**For this lesson I completed the following:**

1. Downloaded Git
2. Configured my text editor
3. Setup Git Repository
4. Made updates to files, tracked changes, and committed files
