## Readings

### Chapter 7: “Forms” (p.144-175)

Forms allow users to input information there are different types of form controls: adding text, making choices (radio buttons, checkboxes, drop-downs), and submitting forms. Various pieces of inputted data need to be differentiated to understand the name and value. Form controls live inside a **form** element and includes action and ID attributes. Forms are sent using get or post. Most forms will use the post method (sent in HTTP headers) because they contain files, sensitive information, long forms. The get method adds the values to the end of the URL specified in the action attribute. Example of input: `<input type="text" name="username" size="15" maxlength="30"/>` (all within a form tag). Max length limits the number of characters entered into the field. Type "password" blocks out the characters typed into the form field. **Text Area** is used to create a multi-line text input. Input type **radio** creates radio button options, example:`<input type="radio" name="genre" value="jazz"/>`with each option listed as a separate radio type. Overall, input types include: password, text area, radio button, checkbox. The **select** element is used to create a drop down list box (aka select box). The **option** element is used to define the values and the **multiple** element is used to allow for multi select. The input type **file** allows for file upload and the **submit** type adds a submit button. An image can be inserted for a button by using the input type **image**. Form elements can be grouped by using the **fieldset** element. Form validation is typically done via Javascript. Type **date** is used to have a date value in a form input. Additional type inputs include: email, URL, search. Placeholder text can be added to a field using the **placeholder** attribute.
