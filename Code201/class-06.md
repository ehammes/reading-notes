## Chapter 3: “Object Literals” (pp.100-105)

Objects group teogether a set of variables and functions to create a model of something. For objects, variables become known as properties (tell us about the object) and functions become known as methods. There are several ways to create objects. Properties or methods of an object can be accessed using dot notation.

## Chapter 5: “Document Object Model” (pp.183-242)

Browsers create a model of a page when it loads the page called its **DOME tree**. Each node is an object with methods and properties Sripts access and update the DOM tree. DOM trees have four types of nodes: document, element, attribute, and text. Accessing and updating the DOM tree involves locating via selecting and traversing. DOM queries may return one element, or they may return a NodeList, which is a collection of nodes.`getElementById()` and `querySelector()` can both search an entire document and return individual elements. Two ways to select an element from a NodeList: `item()` method and array syntax. There are two ways to add and remove content from a DOM tree: the **innerHTML** property and DOM manupulation. Utilize browser tools for viewing the DOM tree. `document.write()` is a simple way to add content, but it is not a recommended approach and is frowned upon. `element.innerHTML` allows you to get and update the entire content of any element (including markup) as a string. It should not be used to add content that has come from a user.
