# Read: 13 - Local Storage

## [“The Past, Present, and Future of Local Storage for Web Applications”](http://diveinto.html5doctor.com/storage.html)

### Before HTML5

Previous solutions were specific to a single browser or reliant on third-party plugins. They also had different interfaces, storage limitations, and user experiences. HTML5 is trying to solve the ability to standardized API, native implementation, and consistency across browsers without having to rely on third parties.

### HTML5 Storage

Web pages store named key/value pairs locally and not within the web browser. Data persists even after a user navigates away from a site, close browser tab, exit browser, etc. This data is never transmitted to the remote web server, unless done so manually. Storage events can be tracked when the storage area changes. Data is stored as strings. A new API has been standardized and implemented across all major browsers, platforms, and devices using the WB SQL data spec.
