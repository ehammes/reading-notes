Emphasize team focused learning. At many companies today, more than 3-quarters of an employee's day is spent communicating with colleagues. At Google, the most productive employees tend to build larger networks by rotating dining companions. Good managers are those who have good communication and avoiding micromanaging is critical. Good group behaviors: members spoke roughly the same amount and have average social sensitivity. Conversational turn-taking and ‘‘average social sensitivity’’ are aspects of what’s known as **psychological safety**. The behaviors that create psychological safety — conversational turn-taking and empathy — are part of the same unwritten rules we often turn to, as individuals, when we need to establish a bond. And those human bonds matter as much at work as anywhere else and sometimes matter more.

**Project Aristotle** is a reminder that when companies try to optimize everything, it’s sometimes easy to forget that success is often built on experiences — such as emotional interactions and complicated conversations and discussions of who we want to be and how our teammates make us feel.
