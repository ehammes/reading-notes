# What is CSS?

**CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)** allows you to create great-looking web pages. CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users — how they are styled, laid out, etc. CSS can be used for very basic document text styling — for example changing the color and size of headings and links. It can be used to create layout — for example turning a single column of text into a layout with a main content area and a sidebar for related information. It can even be used for effects such as animation.

## External stylesheet

An external stylesheet contains CSS in a separate file with a .css extension. This is the most common and useful method of bringing CSS to a document. You can link a single CSS file to multiple web pages, styling all of them with the same CSS stylesheet. In the Getting started with CSS, we linked an external stylesheet to our web page.

You reference an external CSS stylesheet from an HTML **link** element
To link styles.css to index.html, add the following line somewhere inside the **head** of the HTML document:
> <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"

Add styling elements to change the default behavior for all main areas of the page, including header, main, footer, img, etc.
Refer to [CSS Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS) for more information.
