## Growth Mindset

> ***What is a growth mindset?***

- A person with a growth mindset embraces and perseveres through challenges instead of avoiding tough obstacles.
- Instead of staying clear of challenging work and lofty goals, a person with a growth mindset recognizes the success they can accomplish and satisfaction they will feel by maintaining their confidence and focusing on the task at hand.

> ***What are 3 ways to keep yourself in a growth mindset?***

1. Remember to think about how you'll feel at the end of the day when you put in less effort than what you strived for that day, a sense of regret and unfulfillment.
2. Recognize when you are losing focus or avoiding obstacles and help guide yourself back on course and build momentum.
3. Instead of giving up, embrace challenges by using a growth mindset to approach a challenge in a different way in order to help solve the root cause of a problem.
