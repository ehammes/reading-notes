### [What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team](https://www.google.com/amp/mobile.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.amp.html)

The article touches on the importance of team collaboration and having a growth mindset as a team. Teams are more effective and have better morale when there's a fair division of work, effective time management, and a comfortable environment.

### [How I explained REST to my brother](https://gist.github.com/brookr/5977550)

- **Who is Roy Fielding?** Wrote the first web servers, HTTP, that sent documents across the internet and conducted web research
- **Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?** Requirements changed from needing to talk to all of the machines in the world to a small group of machines
- **What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?** HTTP protocol is used to essentially apply verbs to nouns - GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, etc.
- **What does a GET do?** A browser does an HTTP GET on the URL that was typed in and retrieves information to populate and display a web page of information (ie text, images, video, etc.).
- **What does a POST do?** When a system needs to add something to another system
- **What does PUT do?** When a system needs to replace something in another system
- **What does PATCH do?** When a system needs to do a partial update in another system
