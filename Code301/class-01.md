## Reading

The objective of component-based architecture is to ensure component reusability. Props is a special keyword in React and are passed to components like functions.

### [Component-Based Architecture](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/software_architecture_design/component_based_architecture.htm)

1. **What is a “component”?** A component is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exports it as a higher-level interface. Encapsulates functionality and behavior of a software element into a reusable and self-deployable binary unit.
2. **What are the characteristics of a component?** Object oriented view (a set of one or more cooperating classes), conventional view (functional element or module of a program), process-related view (building from existing components). Characteristics of componßents include: resuability, replaceable, not context specific, extensible, encapsulated, independent
3. **What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?** Advantages of components include: ease of deployment, reduced cost, ease of development, reusable, reduced complexity, reliability, easier to maintain and evolve, and independent

1. **What is “props” short for?** Properties
2. **How are props used in React?** Used for passing data from one component to another
3. **What is the flow of props?** Uni-directional flow (one way from parent to child). Props data is read-only and data coming from the parent sould not be changed by child components.
