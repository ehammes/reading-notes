## Reading

### [React Docs - Thinking in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html)

1. **What is the `single responsibility principle` and how does it apply to components?** A technique that a component should ideally only do one thing. If it ends up growing, it should be decomposed into smaller subcomponents.
2. **What does it mean to build a ‘static’ version of your application?** To build a static version of your app that renders your data model, build components that reuse other components and pass data using props. Props pass data from parent to child and don’t use state at all to build this static version. State is reserved only for interactivity - data that changes over time.
3. **Once you have a static application, what do you need to add?** Adding interactivity
4. **What are the three questions you can ask to determine if something is state?**
    1. Is it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it probably isn’t state.
    2. Does it remain unchanged over time? If so, it probably isn’t state.
    3. Can you compute it based on any other state or props in your component? If so, it isn’t state.
5. **How can you identify where state needs to live?**
    - Identify every component that renders something based on that state
    - Find a common owner component (a single component above all the components that need the state in the hierarchy)
    - Either the common owner or another component higher up in the hierarchy should own the state
    - If you can’t find a component where it makes sense to own the state, create a new component solely for holding the state and add it somewhere in the hierarchy above the common owner component.

### [Higher-Order Functions](https://eloquentjavascript.net/05_higher_order.html#h_xxCc98lOBK)

1. **What is a “higher-order function”?** Functions that operate on other functions and allow to abstract over actions
2. **Explore the `greaterThan` function as defined in the reading. In your own words, what is line 2 of this function doing?** Defining that other values are greater than the given value.
3. **Explain how either `map` or `reduce` operates, with regards to higher-order functions.** The `map` method transforms an array by applying a function to all of its elements and building a new array from the returned values. The new array will have the same length as the input array, but its content will have been mapped to a new form by the function. `Reduce` builds a value by repeatedly taking a single element from the array and combining it with the current value.
