### [API Design Best Practices](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/best-practices/api-design)

- **What does REST stand for?** Representational State Transfer
- **REST APIs are designed around a ____.** Resource - any object, data, or service that can be accessed by a client
- **What is an identifier of a resource? Give an example.** A URI that uniquely identifies a resource (ie `https://adventure-wroks.com/orders/1`)
- **What are the most common HTTP verbs?** GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE
- **What should the URIs be based on?** Nouns (the resource) and *not* verbs
- **Give an example of a good URI.** `https://shopping.com/orders`
- **What does it mean to have a ‘chatty’ web API? Is this a good or a bad thing?** A lot of web requests which creates a large load. Avoid "chatty" web APIs.
- **What status code does a successful `GET` request return?** HTTP status code 200 (OK)
- **What status code does an unsuccessful `GET` request return?** HTTP status code 404 (Not Found)
- **What status code does a successful `POST` request return?** HTTP status code 201 (Created)
- **What status code does a successful `DELETE` request return?** HTTP status code 204 (No Content)
