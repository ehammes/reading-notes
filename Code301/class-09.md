- What is functional programming? According to wikipedia, functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data
- What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function? 1. It returns the same result if given the same arguments 2. Does not cause any side effects
- What are the benefits of a pure function? Easier to use unit tests with pure functions.
- What is immutability? Its state cannot change after being created, must create a new object with a new value.
- What is Referential transparency? When a function has the same result for the same input. `pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency`
