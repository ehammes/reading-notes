# Javascript Notes

JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions.
Another essential concept in coding is functions, which allow you to store a piece of code that does a single task inside a defined block, and then call that code whenever you need it using a single short command â€” rather than having to type out the same code multiple times. In this article we'll explore fundamental concepts behind functions such as basic syntax, how to invoke and define them, scope, and parameters.
The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015. Variables are containers for storing data (storing data values).
If you want a general rule: always declare variables with const.
In JavaScript, the equal sign (=) is an "assignment" operator, not an "equal to" operator.
You can declare many variables in one statement. Start the statement with let and separate the variables by comma

Using var, using let, const, sing nothing

## Javascript Identifiers

All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.
These unique names are called identifiers.
Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).
The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:

- Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
- Names must begin with a letter
- Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial)
- Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables)
- Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names

## Javascript Data Types

JavaScript variables can hold numbers like 100 and text values like "John Doe".
In programming, text values are called text strings.
JavaScript can handle many types of data, but for now, just think of numbers and strings.
Strings are written inside double or single quotes. Numbers are written without quotes.
If you put a number in quotes, it will be treated as a text string.
