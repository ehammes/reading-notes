## Introduction to Javascript

Learning to program with JS involges:

1. Understanding some **brasic programming concepts** and the terms that JS programmers user to describe them
2. Learning **the language** itself, and, like all languages, you need to know its vocabulary and how to structure your sentences
3. Becoming familiar with **how it is applied** by looking at examples of how JS is commonly used in websites today.

How Javascript makes web pages more interactive:

1. **Access** content - to select any element, attirbute, or text from an HTML page
2. **Modify** content - to add elements, attributes, and text to the page, or remove them
3. **Program** Rules - specify a set steps for the browser to follow, which allows it to access or change the content of a page
4. **React** to Events - specify that a script should run when a specific event has occurred

**A**: What is a script and how do I create one?
**B** How do computers fit in with the world around them?
**C** How do I write a script for a web page?

A **script** is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal. Examples include comparing scripts to receipes, handbooks, and manuals. Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of all the instructions. Computers approach tasks programmatically. To approach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks.

To write a **script**, you need to first staate your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it:

1. Define the goal
2. Design the script
3. Code each step

Use *flowcharts* to work out how the different tasks fit together.
