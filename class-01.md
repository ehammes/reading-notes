# Read: 01 - Introductory HTML and JavaScript

## Introduction to HTML (pp.2-11)

Rreview how HTML is used to create web pages, how CSS uses rules to enable you to control the styling and layout of web pages (presentation and layout), and finally how to build better websites.People access websites using software called a **web browser**. When you uask your browser for a web page, the rquest is sent across the Internet to a special computer known as a **web server** which hosts the website. **Screen Readers** are programs that read out the contents of a computer screen to a user. All wbesites use HTML and CSS< but content management systems, blogging software, and e-commerce platforms often add a few more technologies into the mix.

## HTML Chapter 1: “Structure” (pp.12-39)

HTML code is made up of **elements** and **tags**. HTML uses elements to describe the structure of pages. Tags act like containers and tell you something about the information that lies between their opening and closing tags. Attriutes tell us more about elements.

## Introduction to Javascript

Learning to program with JS involves:

1. Understanding some **brasic programming concepts** and the terms that JS programmers user to describe them
2. Learning **the language** itself, and, like all languages, you need to know its vocabulary and how to structure your sentences
3. Becoming familiar with **how it is applied** by looking at examples of how JS is commonly used in websites today.

How Javascript makes web pages more interactive:

1. **Access** content - to select any element, attirbute, or text from an HTML page
2. **Modify** content - to add elements, attributes, and text to the page, or remove them
3. **Program** Rules - specify a set steps for the browser to follow, which allows it to access or change the content of a page
4. **React** to Events - specify that a script should run when a specific event has occurred

- **A**: What is a script and how do I create one?
- **B** How do computers fit in with the world around them?
- **C** How do I write a script for a web page?

A **script** is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal. Examples include comparing scripts to receipes, handbooks, and manuals. Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of all the instructions. Computers approach tasks programmatically. To approach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks.

To write a **script**, you need to first staate your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it:

1. Define the goal
2. Design the script
3. Code each step

Use *flowcharts* to work out how the different tasks fit together.

Each physical thing in the world can be represented as an **object**. Each object can have its own properties, events, and methods. Each **property** of an object has a **name** and a **value**. When a specific **event** happens, that event can be used to trigger a specific section of the cose. **Methods** represent things people need to do with objects. The **events**, **models**, and **properties** of a object all relate to each other. Events can trigger methods, and methods can retrieve or update an object's properties.

Types of objects include:

- Window
- Document

### How a browser sees a web page**

1. Receive a page as HTML code
2. Create a model of the page and store it in memory
3. Use a rendering engine to show the page on screen

### How HTML, CSS, & Javascript fit together

Content Layer - .html files, gives the page structure and adds semantics
Presentation Layer - .css files, enhances the HTML page with rules that state how the HTML content is presented
Behavior Layer - .js files, how the page behaves, adding interactivity

Whwn you want to use JavaScript with a web page, you use the HTML `<script>` element to tell the browser it is coming across a script. Its src attribute tells people where the JavaScript file is stored. You may see JavaScript in the HTML between opening `<script>` and closing tags, but it is better to put scripts in their own files.

`document.write('Good afternoon!')` - the **document** object represents the entire web page. The `write()` method of the **document** object allows new content to be written in to the page where the `<script>` element sits. Each piece of intformation is called a **parameter** of the method and the method needs to know what to write to the page. When the browser comes across a `<script>` element, it stops to load the script and then checks to see if it need to do anything.
