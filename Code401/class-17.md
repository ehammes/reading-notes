[AWS Lambda Basics](https://www.serverless.com/aws-lambda)

1. **What is AWS Lambda?** AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS).
2. **Name some use cases for AWS Lambdas.** Scalable APIs (flexible API setups), data processing, task automation
3. **Describe “serverless” to a non-technical friend.** The concept of “serverless” computing refers to not needing to maintain your own servers to run these functions. AWS Lambda is a fully managed service that takes care of all the infrastructure for you. And so “serverless” doesn’t mean that there are no servers involved: it just means that the servers, the operating systems, the network layer and the rest of the infrastructure have already been taken care of, so that you can focus on writing application code.

[CDN](https://cyberhoot.com/cybrary/content-delivery-network-cdn/)

1. **What is a CDN?** A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a geographically distributed group of servers that work together to provide fast delivery of Internet content. A CDN allows for the fast transfer of data needed for loading Internet content including HTML pages, javascript files, stylesheets, images, and videos.
2. **How does a CDN work with relation to the website visitor?** CDNs work through servers nearest to the website visitor respond to the request. The content delivery network copies the pages of a website to a network of servers that are spread out at geographically different locations, caching the contents of the page. When a user requests a webpage that is part of a content delivery network, the CDN will redirect the request from the originating site’s server to a server in the CDN that is closest to the user and deliver the cached content.
3. **What are the benefits of employing a CDN?** Helps protect websites against certain forms of cyber attacks, improve website load speeds and content delivery speeds
