### Reading Prompts

1. What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?

    - I have experience working directly with software developers as well as clients / business stakeholders. This allows me to have different perspectives in gathering and understanding requirements, managing implementations, and triaging / handling major issues. My experience will definitely help me with different scenarios I will face in this career.

2. What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?

    - From the readings, I have a much better understanding of the importance of how to approach problem solving. Instead of jumping right into coding I need to make sure I fully understand and can explain the problem, identify the steps that manually solves the problem, and write the manual steps out as comments or pseudo-code. Taking a step back to understand the problem is an effective way to use one's time and effort. There have definitely been times when I'm throwing ideas at the wall in attempt to solve a problem and realize I'm wasting time hoping I'll luckily figure out the problem by trying different approaches. To be successful, I need to take a step back to make sure I understand the problem and plan my solution effectively.
