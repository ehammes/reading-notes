## Reading

Stack

* A **stack** is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.
* Common terminology for a stack:
  * **Push** - Nodes or items that are put into the stack are pushed
  * **Pop** - Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped. When you attempt to pop an empty stack an exception will be raised.
  * **Top** - This is the top of the stack.
  * **Peek** - When you peek you will view the value of the top Node in the stack. When you attempt to peek an empty stack an exception will be raised.
  * **IsEmpty** - returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false.
* **FILO** - First In Last Out
* **LIFO** - Last In First Out
* Pushing a Node onto a stack will always be an O(1) operation. This is because it takes the same amount of time no matter how many Nodes (n) you have in the stack.
* When adding a Node, you push it into the stack by assigning it as the new top, with its next property equal to the original top.
* Popping a Node off a stack is the action of removing a Node from the top. When conducting a pop, the top Node will be re-assigned to the Node that lives below and the top Node is returned to the user.
* When conducting a peek, you will only be inspecting the top Node of the stack. Typically, you would check isEmpty before conducting a peek. This will ensure that an exception is not raised. Alternately, you can wrap the call in a try/catch block.

Queue

* Common terminology for a queue is
  * **Enqueue** - Nodes or items that are added to the queue.
  * **Dequeue** - Nodes or items that are removed from the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
  * **Front** - This is the front/first Node of the queue.
  * **Rear** - This is the rear/last Node of the queue.
  * **Peek** - When you peek you will view the value of the front Node in the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
  * **IsEmpty** - returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false.
* When you add an item to a queue, you use the enqueue action. This is done with an O(1) operation in time because it does not matter how many other items live in the queue (n); it takes the same amount of time to perform the operation.
* When you remove an item from a queue, you use the dequeue action. This is done with an O(1) operation in time because it doesnâ€™t matter how many other items are in the queue, you are always just removing the front Node of the queue. Typically, you would check isEmpty before conducting a dequeue. This will ensure that an exception is not raised. Alternately, you can wrap the call in a try/catch block.
