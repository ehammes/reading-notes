1. **What native Node.js module allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming?** Event Emitter
2. **What is the value of Object Oriented Programming used in tandem with Event Driven Programming?** The Object Oriented approach promotes the idea that all behavior of an individual unit (or object) be handled from code within that unit. Using this approach, applications are built with many different units that all speak to and interact with each other.
3. **Consider your knowledge of Event Driven Programming in the Web Browser, now explain to a non-technical friend how Event Driven Programming might be useful on the backend using Node.js.** Every time you interact with a webpage through itâ€™s user interface, an event is happening. When you click a button a click event is triggered. When you press a key a keydown event is triggered. These events have associated functions that, when triggered, are executed to make a change to the user interface in some way. Even-driven programming makes use of event handlers and a Main Loop that listens for event triggers and calls the associated event handler for that event.
